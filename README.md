# FullyConnected neural network layer from scratch
Fully connected layer from scratch, with training on MNIST dataset. <br>
The scripts are all for creating a Fully-Connected Neural Network layer and making a custom model. <br>
Also the model trains on fully custom training loop. All the optimizer and loss function are written from scratch.

## Results
I implemented a MLP from scratch only using NumPy for model creation. Here are the results of the training:<br>
